# The structure of code:
- `data.py`: Creates the synthetic data for experiment 01.
- `dica.py`, `msda.py`, `subset_search`: The implementations of DICA algorithm, MSDA algorithm, ICM and greedy ICM.
- `example.py`: A simple example to test the correctness of DICA and ICM implementations.
- `plotting.py`, `utils.py`: Helper functions for visualization and utility functions.
-`experiment_1_top_left.py`: code to reprocuce the result of the top-left image in figure 4 of the paper .

# Process:
- Convert DICA from Matlab to Python correctly.
- Fix some syntax errors in the original code.

# Things todo: 
- Continue reproduce other experiments
- Solve the problem where DICA cannot handle a large number of data samples.
